      </div>
    <div class="modal-body">

      <p class = "modaltext"> 
      During Summer 2018, I was an Engineering Practicum Intern at Google. I worked on a team in Maps in Mountain View!
      <br>
      <br> 
      I designed and developed new features for an internal web application that performs checks on bulk changes made to Google Maps data. The tool is used by 40 teams to process billions of changes annually! 
      <br>
      <br>
      Previously, users had to make extensive queries to find the tests for specific bulk changes. I created a personalized and interactive user workflow by building a new landing page for users. To do this, I implemented a feature that allowed users to save the bulk changes they wanted to monitor; this allowed them to easily view the progress of the tests for these bulk changes. I also added visualizations that allowed users to get a quick snapshot of the test progress. 
      <br>
      <br>
      I did full-stack development using TypeScript with the Angular Framework and Java. 
      </p>
      <h3>Takeaways</h3>
      <img class = "float-lg-right rounded img-responsive" style = "width:30%"src = "img/bike.jpg">
      <p class = "modaltext">
      I really enjoyed my internship at Google! It was a great experience learning a new language and framework (TypeScript and Angular) as well as gaining more experience with languages I was already familar with. Getting to do fullstack development was also a new experience that I enjoyed and learned a lot from. Overall, I really liked the environment at Google -- the community was inclusive, hardworking, and always helpful!

      <h3>Undergraduate Student Instructor</h1>
      <p class = "modaltext"> I really enjoyed taking <a href=https://www.cs61a.org>CS 61A</a> the first semester of my freshman year; I wanted to stay involved with the course by helping teach! After being a lab assistant and tutor for the course, I became an undergraduate student instructor (TA). I taught weekly lab and discussion sections to about thirty students. During sections, I gave mini lectures about topics covered in lecture and went through different problems from a worksheet. I also held weekly office hours where I assisted students with understanding key concepts and gave guidance on homework assignments and projects. <br> <br> After TAing for CS 61A for three semesters, I will be a TA for  <a href=https://sp19.datastructur.es/>CS 61B</a>, Berkeley's Data Structures course! I'm excited to teach this course, especially because it is my favorite CS course I've taken at Berkeley so far! </p>
      <h3>CSM Senior Mentor</h1>
      <p class= "modaltext">
      In addition to being on course staff, I am also a part of Computer Science Mentors, an organization geared towards providing extra support to students in lower division computer science courses, especially students who are from underrepresented areas of CS. I have been a Senior Mentor for CS 61A for the last couple semesters. I teach a small group section of CS 61A students weekly; additionally as a senior mentor, I develop new content (worksheets, teaching guides) and meet with a group of junior mentors and go over how to teach each week's material and give general teaching advice. 
      </p>
      <h3>Takeaways</h3>
      <p class = "modaltext">
      I have loved being a part of course staff and CSM; I have grown as a teacher and enjoy getting to know individuals in this wholesome teaching community!
