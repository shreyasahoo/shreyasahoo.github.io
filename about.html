        I'm Shreya, a freshman at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science. I enjoy developing, designing, and teaching. I am interested in the intersection of CS and education, specifically special education. I want to expand the technology available for students with special needs. 
        <br> </br>
        I am an academic intern for CS61A, the introductory CS class at Berkeley. I am also a member of the Association of Women in EECS (AWE). Last August, I was selected CS KickStart, a weeklong program hosted by AWE for freshmen women in CS. I am currently an organizer for CS KickStart 2017, as a member of the Industrial Relations Comittee.

        In my free time, I love to cook and do modern calligraphy!
